```{r}
vec = c(2, 3, 18)
vec
```

```{r}
vec[-1]
```

```{r}
vec[c(1, 2)]
```

```{r}
abs(-3)
```

```{r}
seq(from = 5, to = 20, by = 2)
```

```{r}
seq(from = 5, to = 20, length.out = 10)
```

```{r}
vec[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

```{r}
10 == 5
10 < 5
10 > 5
sum(vec)
sum(vec > 4)
```

We can also combine conditions

```{r}
(10 > 5) & (2 > 3)
(10 > 5) | (2 > 3)
name[region == 'west']
```

```{r}
name[region] == "Northeast"
income[region] == "Northeast"

med_income = median(income[region == "Northeast"])
name[income == med_income]
```

```{r}
length(name)
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
